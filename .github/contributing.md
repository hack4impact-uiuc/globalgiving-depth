We'd like to keep the repo as clean and understandable as possible, so here's an outline of what the contributing process should look like:

* Identify improvement to make; make an issue for it. If possible, this issue should relate back to one of the epic issues.
* Create a branch to work on. This might be off `master` or another branch.
* Create a PR describing your developments. Make sure to link it to your issue. Until the PR is ready for review, the title should be prefaced by "[WIP]" to show it's a work in progress. PRs can only be merged after at least one approving review.
* Your PR also needs to pass tests and linting before it can be merged, so make sure you are writing tests and paying attention to style.
