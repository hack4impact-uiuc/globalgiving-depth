The Pop is the man behind the scene. He is a true champion. Before mother nature can help us, we need the big daddy aka The Pop to help show us the best ways to toil and work our farm. He is constantly working to find ways to make life easier for us. Hence why he is a bit tanned. He doesn\u2019t talk much. Most times only our Chief Ashaari understands what he says. Some plant language going on between the two of them. With the help of Ashaari and The Pop, we are slowly unlocking great methods so that urban folks can experience the beauty and joy of growing your own food. Start small, start big, start failing and start succeeding. Key word is start. At least that\u2019s the only English word he\u2019s learnt so far. Join The Pop in creating this revolution. Let\u2019s put a farm in every house. It\u2019s time to listen to your inner Pop. Let\u2019s start! Copyright \u00a9 2019 Poptani Asia. All Rights Reserved.

About Poptani - A Farm in Every House Poptani Asia started in 2015 with one vision in mind - A Farm In Every House. Food crisis, environmental degradation and over population are some issues that is brewing in this world today. The dependencies of urban dwellers on other people to produce food is one huge contributing factor to the problems above. There is enough research to prove that urban farming is a great and simple solution all of us can embark on. The \u2018Pop\u2019 and team are committed to help turn every home into a food production machine as well. Through the use of appropriate technology and innovation, we can now build modular farm units that can suit different types of homes. Some of our designs are completely indoors. In this quest, we are implementing various urban farming approaches to suit different home conditions, from soil based gardens to hydroponics.  Our favourite method is Aquaponics! Our products and services also cater to different levels, from educational tools for kids to real serious setups that could feed your family. Whichever level you are, we have a solution for you!  We\u2019re here to make urban farming convenient, easy, and fun for everyone, one step at a time. We envision a world where people think of food in so much abundance, because every single person is producing food more then what they consume. Fresh, healthy and plenty! Let\u2019s put an end to our food problems, one house at a time. Aquaponics Fish feed plants, plants clean water for fish. Aquaponics is a more natural and efficient form of home farming. It\u2019s a symbiotic system of fish and plants, where through the simple act of feeding fish, you can quickly grow a variety of plants for cooking. The water in the system cycles around; plants love the nutrient rich fish water, and fish love the water being cleaned for them. This cycle is the age-old way nature has developed to sustain itself. Eat natural Learn about what you can grow in different conditions, and how easy it is to grow and produce delicious meals. Poptani sells different sized Aquaponics kits which allow you to grow organic herbs, fruit and vegetables. These allow for varying sized fish for decoration or for food.

It is carried out keeping in mind the child\u2019s best interest. Children referred by SCAN-Goa for further education, skills development and job placements are monitored periodically. This helps SCAN-Goa to change the rehabilitation plan if required. Social Investigation There is lack of probation services in Goa. The Juvenile Justice Board (North and South) refers cases to SCAN-Goa to conduct home studies and submit the Social Investigation Report.\u00a0 The home visits are jointly conducted by the lawyer and social worker. The report provides an overview of the present status of the child and the rehabilitation required. Community Service SCAN-Goa was the pioneer agency to develop linkages between Juvenile Justice Boards, police and institutions. After a conviction, the child is referred to us and depending upon the crime an appropriate community service is planned for the child. The placement is monitored regularly, and there is regular interaction with the community agency. Job Placement Children are referred to SCAN-Goa by the police, public prosecutors, Juvenile Justice Boards or by the community. SCAN-Goa is associated with hotel industries who provide job opportunities for these children referred by the organisation.
