## Problem

GlobalGiving knows that many nonprofit organizations are active and doing great work around the world, but they do not always have the knowledge or channel to make a connection with all of them. Given that there are many organizations working in many communities around the world, GlobalGiving must choose wisely which ones to initiate a contact with.

There are several factors to consider when deciding which organizations to reach; the most important of these is the type of work that each organization does. The exigent GlobalGiving categories are descriptive for the majority of NGOs, however there is some room for improvement, and there are some challenges presented by these categories when algorithmically classifying work done by an NGO.
